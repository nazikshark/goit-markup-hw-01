# GoIT Markup Homework #01

This is the first homework assignment of the HTML/CSS course. It focuses on creating a semantic HTML structure for a landing page based on a provided layout.

## 📋 Project Overview
The goal of this project was to implement a clean, accessible, and valid HTML markup using modern semantic tags without any CSS styling.

## 🚀 Technical Requirements Implemented:

### 🏗 Project Structure:
- **Index**: Main markup file is `index.html`.
- **Images**: All graphical assets are stored in the `/images` folder.
- **Optimization**: Raster images (JPG) have been optimized via Squoosh.
- **Formatting**: The source code is formatted using Prettier.

### 📑 Semantic Markup:
- **Structural Tags**: Used `<header>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>` to define the page structure.
- **Navigation**: The `<nav>` tag is used exactly once in the header.
- **Headers Hierarchy**: A single `<h1>` tag for the main title and `<h2>` for section headings.
- **Contacts**: Email and Phone links are placed correctly within the header but outside the `<nav>` element.
- **Lists**: All groups of similar elements (nav links, features, team, etc.) are wrapped in `<ul>` lists.
- **Logo**: Implemented as a text link `<a>`, not an image, as per requirements.
- **Buttons**: The "Order Service" element is a `<button>` with `type="button"`.
- **Media**: All `<img>` tags include `width` and descriptive `alt` attributes.

## 🛠 Technologies Used:
- HTML5 (Semantic elements)
- W3C Validator compliance
